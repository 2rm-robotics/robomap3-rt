DESCRIPTION = "\
The nodelet package is designed to provide a way to run multiple \
algorithms in the same process with zero copy transport between \
algorithms. \
This package provides both the nodelet base class needed for \
implementing a nodelet, as well as the NodeletLoader class used \
for instantiating nodelets\
