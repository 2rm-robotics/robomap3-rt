Subject: [PATCH 1/2] address gcc6 build error

With gcc6, compiling fails with `stdlib.h: No such file or directory`,
as including '-isystem /usr/include' breaks with gcc6, cf.,
https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70129.

This commit addresses this issue for this package in almost the same way
it was addressed in various other ROS packages. A list of related
commits and pull requests is at:

    https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/issues/12783

Particularly when searching for the Boost library CMake sets
Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS to @SYSROOT@/usr/include which should be
avoided in the `-isystem` option of gcc.
