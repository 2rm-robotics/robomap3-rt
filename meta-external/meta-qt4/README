meta-qt4
========

This layer provides Qt 4.x libraries. Its intended use is for passing LSB tests
as Qt4 is a requirement for LSB; however the libraries may also be used for any
other purpose requiring Qt4.

Usage
-----

Please refer to the README file in meta-qt3 for instructions, replacing qt3 references
with qt4 as appropriate:
