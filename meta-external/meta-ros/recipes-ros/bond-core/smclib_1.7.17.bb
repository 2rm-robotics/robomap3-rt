DESCRIPTION = "\
The State Machine Compiler (SMC) from http://smc.sourceforge.net/ \
converts a language-independent description of a state machine \
into the source code to support that state machine. \
This package contains the libraries that a compiled state machine \
depends on, but it does not contain the compiler itself. \
