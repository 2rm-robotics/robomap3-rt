DESCRIPTION = "sound_play provides a ROS node that translates commands on a ROS topic \
(<tt>robotsound</tt>) into sounds. The node supports built-in sounds, playing OGG/WAV files, \
and doing speech synthesis via festival. C++ and Python bindings allow this node to be used \
without understanding the details of the message format, allowing faster development and \
resilience to message format changes."
