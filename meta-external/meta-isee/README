I. Building the meta-isee BSP layer
=========================================

In order to build an image with BSP support for a given release, you
need to download the corresponding BSP repository.

  $ git clone -b denzil git://git.isee.biz/pub/scm/poky.git

Enter to the poky directory,

  $ cd poky

and clone the meta-isee layer.

  $ git clone -b denzil git://git.isee.biz/pub/scm/meta-isee.git

  $ source oe-init-build-env

Having done that, and assuming you downloaded the BSP contents
at the top-level of your yocto build tree, you can build a igep
image by adding the location of the meta-isee layer to
conf/bblayers.conf, e.g.:

        <path to>/meta-isee \

To enable the isee layer, add the igep00x0 MACHINE to conf/local.conf:

  MACHINE ?= "igep00x0"

You should then be able to build a image as such:

  $ bitbake core-image-sato

At the end of a successful build, you should have a image that
you use boot from flash or a micro-SD card.
