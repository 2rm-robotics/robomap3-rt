I. Overview
============
This README is about IGEP Firmware by ISEE (www.isee.biz).
This file contains information about HOWTO create a SD-Card to boot
the latest IGEP Firmware for your IGEP Technology device.
Also it explains HOWTO flash default factory firmware using that
SD-Card as a recovery method.

Please see the corresponding sections above for details.

This software is provided entirely and is not licensed for any use other
than evaluation purposes of the IGEP technology based devices.

This software provides a mobile environment and visual style for
IGEP embedded devices. The image supports X11 with a Sato theme,
Pimlico applications and contains terminal, editor, and file manager.


II. Create IGEP Firmware bootable SD-card
==========================================
The IGEP Firmware package (igep_firmware-yocto-1.2.1-x.tar.bz) contains these files:

  * README.txt:
      This file (you are reading NOW !)
  * igep-media-create:
      BASH script that creates bootable IGEP SD-card with your personal computer
  * e-functions:
      BASH script with helper functions
  * demo-image-sato-igep00x0.tar.bz:
      Compressed package file (with bootloader, kernel and root filesystem)
  * VERSION:
      IGEP Firmware version of this package ("IGEP Firmware Yocto 1.2.1-x")
  * CHANGELOG:
      History of changes about IGEP firmware versions (changelog)

This tarball contains a bootable image, which can be used to directly
boot the firmware stored on a SD-card.

Under Linux, insert a SD-card media and use igep-media-create script to copy
the image to SD-card media.

 $ ./igep-media-create --mmc <mmc> --image <image file> --machine <machine>

where,

  <mmc>        - is the SD-Card device of your computer.
  <image file> - is the file that contains bootloader, kernel and rootfs image.
  <machine>    - is the IGEP Processor Board. Available options are:
                   igep0020 - For IGEP v2 Processor Board
                   igep0030 - For IGEP COM MODULE Processor Board
                   igep0032 - For IGEP COM PROTON Processor Board

For example, assuming the SD-card device takes '/dev/sdf' and 
you have an IGEPv2 board ('igep0020'), type

 $ ./igep-media-create --mmc /dev/sdf --image demo-image-sato-igep00x0.tar.bz --machine igep0020

This should give you a bootable SD-card.

III. Booting IGEP device and login/connect methods 
===================================================
Insert the SD-card media into the micro-SD card socket of IGEP device and power on it.
This should result in a running system with Sato graphical desktop root filesystem built by Yocto.

If you want login in/connect to the system, you have several options:
 o Ethernet, you should assign an IP in the range 192.168.5.[2-254] and connect
         to target using a SSH client and connecting to 192.168.5.1
 o Wifi, connect to IGEP_xx network, a dynamic IP should be assigned in your
         host and you can sign into the target connecting to 192.168.6.1
 o USB ethernet gadget, connect a IGEP device to USB port of your computer, 
         dynamic IP should be assigned in your host and you can sign into 
         the target connecting to 192.168.7.1
 o (if available) Graphical interface on plugged DVI/TFT display and USB Keyboard in IGEP device
 
The root password is empty, so to log in type 'root' for the user name and hit
'Enter' at the Password prompt: and you should be in.


IV. Update IGEP device flash with lastest IGEP Firmware
========================================================
Once your system booted from the SD-card, you can write the firmware into the
flash. Enter into an IGEP root terminal an run,

 # igep-flash --image /opt/firmware/demo-image-sato-igep00x0.tar.bz

When finish, power off your board, unplug the micro-SD card and power on the
board. That's all, enjoy the new firmware running from the flash memory. 

-------------------------------
NOTE: Speed up flash procedure
-------------------------------
By default the flash script runs the nandtest command to mark bad blocks, this
can take a long time and in most cases is not necessary, you can speed up the
flash procedure running the script as follows:

 # igep-flash --image /opt/firmware/demo-image-sato-igep00x0.tar.bz --skip-nandtest
